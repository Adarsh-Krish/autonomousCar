# Virtual Autonomous Car Simulation

This project is a comprehensive simulation of autonomous vehicles using both Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Rule-Based Systems. The goal is to compare the adaptability, efficiency, and overall performance of vehicles controlled by these two different methods in a dynamic virtual environment.

## Project Overview

Autonomous vehicles represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, with the potential to transform modern transportation systems. This project aims to develop a virtual simulation from scratch, implementing genetic algorithms to control a self-driving car's decision-making process and comparing it with a traditional rule-based system.

### Key Features:
- **Genetic Algorithm-Based Control:** Implements a genetic algorithm to optimize vehicle behavior, focusing on speed, navigation, and obstacle avoidance.
- **Rule-Based System:** Utilizes predefined rules to control vehicle movement, serving as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of the genetic algorithm.
- **Virtual World Environment:** A simulated environment with various road types and obstacles, including simple straight roads, curved roads, intersections, and urban settings.

## Project Objectives

- **Primary Objective:** To build a virtual self-driving car simulation and compare the performance of genetic algorithms and rule-based systems.
- **Secondary Objective:** To design and implement a testing environment that evaluates both approaches under different road conditions.
